## Console.log

This [article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/its-2022-please-don-t-just-use-console-log-anymore-217638337c7d) made me want to try to improve my console logging. 
- Use an object to have more details info about what you are logging `console.log({age, name, food, paint})` will give you the name of the variables and the value you are printing!
- Using warn or error will show in the console so if you have a lot of logs and want to get the attention: `console.warn()` or `console.error()` 
- Something I never had to think about, but if I wanted to get the interval of time for the execution of some code? 
```
console.time()
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
  count++
}
console.timeEnd()
```

- And finally if you have a big object to log? `console.table()` makes it pretteeeeh

## Colleague frustration (but actually it's me the colleague)

It's hard to find the balance between being helped and being advised stuffs you already know. Especially when you explained the problem. However I understand that it takes some brain power to understand what someone is saying. And at the end, not helping me the way I wanted still - tought me something - made me find the origin of the pb solve alone. 
Also felt bad about deploying and leaving. Do not do that. Deployment before lunch. Or before one hour leaving the job.
And if you come back from holidays, don't get upset people have taking your tasks.

##Â Going to work

It's always tempting in the evening to say I'll go to work in the morning. It's always impossible in the morning to decide to go wake up on time. But when I do..  

### A little guide for a bunch of cu*ts on bikes

- You don't need to prove anything. It's ok to stay behind.  
- If I am slowing down because there is traffic and people slowing down / stopping, and I am like less than a meter from the next bike, it is a dick move to just cut in front of me. You would not do that as a car. You just slow down as people are slowing down. 
- If I can smell your new bag full of petroleum when you pass me, you are too close. 
- When 3 people are just biking shoulder to shoulder, you *need* to accept your are going at the same speed and it is ok to be one behind the other. You are blocking people otherwise. 
- It is ok to be on the left side and to be passed by people. 
- Bike to work is a very strong place for toxic masculinity. I now have fantasies of biking and kick all those guys and see them fall like dominos of glorified balls. 

It feels better now.  
Also I really love the showers at work. I feel like I'm the hotel. 

### Important work 

This week I am in charge of little but important work. 
I am changing the type of a flag, which let us turn off ad and 'push to subscribe' on articles that moves british (I don't know if you've seen, the queen is dead, long live the queen and please subscribe to see more about that news). 
I am also changing one of the layout of the news for it to be in mourning (no longer mourn for me when I am dead). So now we can have a big photo and then text under, all that in a black background. 
Nothing much but touches new stuffs and it's very important for the news to come so I feel happy.
